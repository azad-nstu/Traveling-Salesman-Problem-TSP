This directory includes all the graph data that used for this experiment.
It also includes main program "tsp_sol_final-12210325.py", output file "output.txt", Excel file "Result.xlsx" to organize the output, distance_figure.py and time_figure.py to draw and store the result analysis graph, saved figures, etc.

tsp_sol_final-12210325.py 
	- is the main programming file where 4 algorithms (Brute force, nearest neighbors, Genetic algorithm, and Proposed 2-step nearest neighbor) were implemented in 4 functions.
	- .graph file have to be in the same directory to run this and we can choose different graph by selecting the file name in line-363. 
	- To draw a graph, we can use the function "nodes_position = draw_graph(adj_matrix)" in line-373. If not necessary we can comment it (specially for large graph)
	- We will uncomment 1 function (between lines: 389-392) at a time to run 1 of 4 algorithm.
		- To run the algorithm once, we will set the start node in line- 384.
		- To run the algorithm multiple times and get the best result, in line- 379, we can set the "num_of_random_tries" value accordingly, uncomment the line start_node = random_number (line-383), and make comment start_node = 0 (line- 384)
	- To draw the graph for final tour, "draw_graph_with_tour(adj_matrix, min_tour, nodes_position)" function (in line-438) used. 
		- To use this function, we must use "nodes_position = draw_graph(adj_matrix)" in line-373 function because it takes nodes_position from that function.

output.txt
	- Output of the algorithms (cost/distance, tour/path, execution time) stored in this file.
	
Result.xlsx
	- Organize the results from output.txt file.
	
distance_figure.py
	- Used to draw and save the figure of Distances Vs. Number of Cities comparison among 4 algorithms. 
	
time_figure.py
	- Used to draw and save the figure of Execution Time Vs. Number of Cities comparison among 4 algorithms.
