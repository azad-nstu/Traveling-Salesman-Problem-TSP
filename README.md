Travelling-Salesman-Problem-TSP-
Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a well-known NP-hard problem that aims to find the optimal tour among different cities to visit each city exactly once and 
return to the original city. This directory includes all the graph data used for this experiment.

This project implements brute force, nearest neighbor, genetic algorithms, and a new 2-step nearest neighbor algorithm to solve TSP.

You may need to read the Instructions.txt file before accessing the code in the tsp_solutions.py file.
